## Data Preparation

This implementation assumes that the customermgmt.xml file has already been parsed, and that the path of the table is hard-coded in the CustomerMgmtView.sql file in the base directory. For logic that will parse the xml file feel free to reference the py file in the databricks folder in helpers.

### Configuration and running

No special considerations
