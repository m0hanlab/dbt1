# What is this?
This project contains two distinct portions:
1. A CLI developed using [Snowpark Python](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/python/index) and [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/). This CLI creates tables in Snowflake for the files generated by the [TPC-DI](https://www.tpc.org/tpcdi/) benchmark specification.
2. A [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) project using [Snowflake Dynamic Tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-tables-about) for building the data warehouse defined in the TPC-DI specification.


![Figure 1.2–1 from the TPC-DI specification describes the ETL process.](images/tpc-di-etl-diagram.png)

I should be clear in my goal here: I am not attempting to _actually run and measure_ the TPC-DI benchmark.
The `tpcdi.py` CLI in this repository is single-threaded and ingests the data sequentially, which would be the worst approach if trying to optimize for a benchmark.
Instead, I needed a dataset that could be used to mimic data engineering workloads inside of Snowflake, so I just wanted the files loaded.


![Figure 1.4–1 from the TPC-DI specification describes the target logical model. More on DimTrade later.](images/tpc-di-logical-model.png)


I took a few liberties with the TPC-DI specification to update it a bit for Snowflake. I replaced `CamelCase` names with `SNAKE_CASE`, mostly out of irritation with readability.
Secondly, I just couldn't stand for having the `DimTrade` table be "both a dimension table and a fact table, depending on how it is being used" as it was designed by TPC-DI.
This decision was made during an era when storage and compute were constrained, so in my design, I created both `DIM_TRADE` and `FACT_TRADE` tables.
Finally, I used a Medallion Lakehouse Architecture with Bronze, Silver, and Gold zones, with the logical model above materialized in the Gold zone.

# Demo Notebook
I've included a [demo Jupyter notebook](demo.ipynb) that walks through a subset of the instructions below. This notebook pairs with a presentation I give that focuses more on how Snowpark Python was used in the CLI, and also the motivation for using Dynamic Tables with dbt. But it may still be helpful.

# Using DIGen.jar to Generate Source Files
The Java program to generate the source files is downloaded by [filling out a form on the TPC-DI website](https://www.tpc.org/TPC_Documents_Current_Versions/download_programs/tools-download-request5.asp?bm_type=TPC-DI&bm_vers=1.1.0&mode=CURRENT-ONLY) and clicking a link in an email. Once unzipped, we have to make one slight change for running on macOS:

```bash
unzip 66a2b600-af36-4198-bfbc-c94c40cc22af-tpc-di-tool.zip && \
mv Tools/PDGF Tools/pdgf && \ #clearly written on a case-insensitive OS
cd Tools
```

I couldn't find any way to execute the provided JAR with a Java version newer than `1.8`. I spent some time trying to rebuild the JAR file using a newer Java version for posterity, but it was a fool's errand.
I installed [Azul Zulu Java 1.8](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk#zulu) and used [jEnv](https://www.jenv.be/) to set a local version, and with that, we can see the help context from the JAR:

```
jenv add /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-8.jdk/Contents/Home && \
jenv local 1.8 && \
java -jar DIGen.jar --help

usage: DIGen
 -h                   print this message
 -jvm <JVM options>   JVM options. E.g. -jvm "-Xms1g -Xmx2g"
 -o <directory>       Specify output directory.  Default is output.
 -sf <sf>             Scale factor.  Default value is 5. (range: 3 -
                      2147483647
 -v                   print DIGen version
 ```

This utility will generate a bunch of different data files in various formats with a scaling (or multiplication) factor determining how much data the files contain. 
It attempts to mimic ETL processes at the time the specification was written, which generally utilized file extracts from source systems. It generates CSVs and pipe-separated files (PSVs?), which are quite simple with Snowpark. 
The two file formats that proved the most fun and challenging were fixed-width fields and XML, as both required heavy DataFrame transformations. The files are generated in batches, with `Batch1` representing the historical load, and `Batch2` and `Batch3` representing various incremental loads. 
Currently, I've only tested the loader against `Batch1` and the dbt models have not yet been extended to handle additional batches. 
Also, I haven't yet implemented the Audit portion of the specification, which is somewhat embarrassing as a former co-founder of a data quality company.

# The Python Snowpark Loader: tpcdi.py
I used Conda to build my virtual environment, with all the steps to replicate in the snippet below:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml && \
conda activate tpcdi && \
python tpcdi.py --help
```

![Output from `tpcdi.py --help`](images/tpcdi-help.png)

I created the loader using Typer for the CLI interface and Snowpark for uploading files, creating DataFrames from those files -- in some cases doing heavy transformations -- and saving them as tables. 
Credentials are provided using a credentials.json file in the root directory, and looks like this:

```json
{
    "account": "myaccount",
    "user": "myuser",
    "password": "mypassword",
    "role": "myrole",
    "warehouse": "stewart_dev",
    "database": "tpc_di",
    "schema": "digen"
}
```

Some improvements could be made to the credentials, schema, and database handling.
The utility writes the data to whatever database and schema is specified in the credentials, so those aspects of the connection are required.
Loading the files is accomplished with the process-files command and we can see the help context below:

```
❯ python tpcdi.py process-files --help
```

![Output from `tpcdi.py process-files --help`](images/tpcdi-process-files-help.png)

Let's start by loading a rather simple file - the `StatusType.txt`  which is pipe-delimited. 
I'll first demonstrate the `--show` option, which displays a sample of the DataFrame instead of loading it to a table. 
As you might have guessed, I added this option to aid in the development of the loader. 
Then I'll demonstrate loading the table:

```
❯ python tpcdi.py process-files --output-directory ~/dev/tpcdi-output \
--file-name StatusType.txt --show

File StatusType.txt: UPLOADED
-----------------------
|"ST_ID"  |"ST_NAME"  |

|ACTV     |Active     |
|CMPT     |Completed  |
|CNCL     |Canceled   |
|PNDG     |Pending    |
|SBMT     |Submitted  |
|INAC     |Inactive   |
-----------------------

❯ python tpcdi.py process-files --output-directory ~/dev/tpcdi-output \
--file-name StatusType.txt      

File StatusType.txt: SKIPPED
STATUS_TYPE table created.

❯ snowsql -c demo
* SnowSQL * v1.2.27

stewartbryson#STEWART_DEV@TPC_DI.DIGEN>select * from STATUS_TYPE;

| INAC  | Inactive  |
+-------+-----------+
6 Row(s) produced. Time Elapsed: 0.752s
stewartbryson#STEWART_DEV@TPC_DI.DIGEN>
```

Notice that the second execution used Snowpark's `overwrite=False` feature of skipping already existing files during a put, which can be overridden with the `--overwrite` option.
For now, let's get the rest of the files loaded so we can move on to the dbt models. 
All DataFrames are saved in `overwrite` mode, so we can run it again without duplicating data:

```bash
❯ python tpcdi.py process-files --output-directory ~/dev/tpcdi-output  

File Date.txt: UPLOADED
DATE table created.
File DailyMarket.txt: UPLOADED

# Building the Data Warehouse with dbt
I could have also used Snowpark Python to build the transformation pipelines as well, but instead, I wanted to use Dynamic Tables, and the ability to easily do this using dbt made the decision easy.

In the Medallion architecture, we typically append raw data in their original format into Bronze, business entities modeled in Silver, and our highly curated facts and dimensions in Gold. 
I'm loading with an x-small warehouse and 4 threads, with a `DIGen.jar` scaling factor of 10.
The dbt DAG looks like this:

```

Once the DAG has been created in Snowflake, we can browse it in the UI:

![Snowflake Graph](images/snowflake-dag.png)

It's important to note that Snowflake is only aware of all the dependent relations _after_ the tables have been created.
dbt is aware of them before.

# Future Enhancements
Although it wasn't my goal, it would be cool to enhance this project so that it could be used to run and measure the benchmark. 
These are my thoughts on where to take this next:

1. Complete `Batch2` and `Batch3` using dbt incremental models, and put the audit queries in as dbt tests.
2. Refactor tpcdi.py to only upload the files and do that concurrently, then put all the Snowpark transformations into procedures so they can be executed as concurrent tasks.
3. Maybe take another pass at credential handling, using the `config.toml` from [Snowflake CLI](https://github.com/snowflake-labs/snowcli#cli-tour-and-quickstart).
Provide a command-line option `--schema` so it can be specified during loading, instead of using `CURRENT_SCHEMA`.

If you are interested in contributing, jump on board. You don't need my permission, or even incredible skill, clearly.
